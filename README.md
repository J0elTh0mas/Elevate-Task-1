# Elevate-Task-1
Using nmap to scan open ports and then proceed to use wireshark to analyze packets
This task involves the use of two tools namely "nmap" and "WIRESHARK" these tools are already preloaded on Kali Linux as well as these tools can also be obtained from their respective websites.
nmap will be used to scan for open ports this tool can also be used for finding the service versions that are running which will allow for finding outdated services which can help in identifying security risks or vulnerabilities.
Wireshark is used for packet capture and can be used to read raw packets which can provide deeper insight for analysis.


This task started with me using zenmap to run the windows version of nmap which provides a GUI that can make it easier to navigate, while attempting for a -sS scan for my local range range. While this scan was running I used wireshark to analyze these packets.
