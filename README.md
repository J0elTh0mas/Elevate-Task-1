# Elevate-Task-1
Using nmap to scan open ports and then proceed to use wireshark to analyze packets
This task involves the use of two tools namely "nmap" and "WIRESHARK" these tools are already preloaded on Kali Linux which will be used on Oracle's "virtualbox".
nmap will be used to scan for open ports this tool can also be used for finding the service versions that are running which will allow for finding outdated services which can help in identifying security risks or vulnerabilities.
Wireshark is used for packet capture and can be used to read raw packets which can provide deeper insight for analysis.
